I guess I should make my <span class="hashtag">#introduction</span>

I'm enigmalea. Most people call me enig or lea, but my real name is Amber. I'm fandom old (30+), queer (<span class="hashtag">#nonbinary</span>, <span class="hashtag">#bi</span> or <span class="hashtag">#pan</span>, <span class="hashtag">#demi</span>, and <span class="hashtag">#polyam</span> leaning). I'm almost 100% positive I'm ADHD, but I have no formal diagnosis.
Hope to get one soon.

My main fandom obsession is <span class="hashtag">#DragonAge</span>, and I write fanfic: a little <span class="hashtag">#Solavellan</span> and a lot of <span class="hashtag">#slash</span>. Side-fandoms include a bunch of <span class="hashtag">#anime</span>, <span class="hashtag">#Pokemon</span>, <span class="hashtag">#Marvel</span>, <span class="hashtag">#DC</span>, <span class="hashtag">#DoctorWho</span>, etc, etc. I probably have at least a passing interest in most sci-fi or fantasy.

In 2021, I created a Discord bot after waking up and thinking "I could do that", and have been diving more into <span class="hashtag">#FOSS</span>, <span class="hashtag">#decentralization</span>, and tech freedom.

I moderate several discord communities (Dragon Age and Fandom Coding-related) and fandom projects (<span class="hashtag">#zines</span>).

Feel free to follow. No specific requirements, yet, as I'm just getting settled in.
