Watching the birbsite explode has brought back memories of GJ (greatestjournal) and other <span class="hashtag">#livejournal</span> clones (and LJ itself) folding so easily.

I fondly remember backing up my personal and roleplaying journals on lj-sec. I'm pretty sure I still have those archives (and an lj-sec install file) on an old external harddrive somewhere. People fled in mass numbers.

Some of those sites still exist: deadjournal, insanejournal, scribbld, and dreamwidth are all still up and running, and some of those still have flourishing communities.

I still have my lifetime LJ account and can log in, but I no longer recognize what's happened to it. It feels an awful lot like the desiccated husk of a tauntaun that has been infiltrated by corporations and advertisers.
