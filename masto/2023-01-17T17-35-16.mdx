<h2>Qunari Headcanons</h2>

<p>Because the flavor of moment is "Qunari" have a few of my qunari headcanons.
Feel free to use them or expand on them!</p> <ul> <li><p>Although Qunari in
cities live alone, they tend to eat in groups or with friends. This is because
the Qun prizes efficiency, and it's more efficient for those with interest and
skill in cooking to cook for many people than for everyone to cook for
themselves.</p> <p>In some situations this is probably a formal process (for
example, there is likely a team of cooks who serve the Antaam
("<em>military</em>")), I imagine there are less formal potlucks occurring
between friends. It seems entirely possible that it's not considered odd for 4-5
people to throw their rations together to make a meal, and for all of them to
show up at one location with their own dinnerware to eat together.</p></li>
<li><p>There are Qunari whose roles include doing laundry and cleaning living
spaces for others, which allows individuals to focus on their own roles. Because
all roles are treated equally under the Qun people do, usually, try to keep
their spaces relatively neat out of respect - they don't wish to make other
people's jobs harder</p></li> <li><p>Although many bas don't realize it, Qunari
don't think of leisure time, hobbies, the arts or entertainment as inefficient.
They recognize that relaxation and interests are enriching and often allow
workers to be more efficient in their roles.</p> <p>This is based on the fact
that Bull's entry in the <em>World of Thedas, Vol 2</em> mentions Imekari
playing. They wouldn't bother teaching them to play if they didn't want leisure
time to continue. In addition, Sten shows interest in art, but isn't surprised
it exists.</p></li> <li><p>Par Vollen is rich in spices, and so is Qunari food.
Even their drinks are full of herbs, and when they drink coffee or tea it is
serve with cinnamon, cloves, nurmeg and other aromatic spices.</p></li>
<li><p>We know from canon that hot cocoa is common in Par Vollen, but not in the
southern parts of Thedas. I believe there are two types of hot cocoa - spicy and
sweet. Spicy hot cocoa is served thicker and with vanilla, cinnamon, and chili
powder (similar to real world Aztec cocoa), while sweet hot cocoa is served with
extra sugar and cream. The Iron Bull prefers sweet cocoa, though he generally
like spicy foods.</p></li> <li><p>Since the Qunari despise waste, they have a
lot of roles focused on mending, repairing, and reusing resources. Tailors,
cobblers, and smiths are common. They have a rich "second hand" economy, where
clothing that has been outgrown is taken in, repaired, and redistributed, and
similarly, where items which are no longer reparable are broken down for use in
other applications.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Check out my

https://enigmalea.dreamwidth.org/62786.html I am so fucking tired of the entire
ass Dragon Age fandom falling over top of one another to fucking be
woke.<br /><br />No Cullen is not fucking creepy because he had a crush
at 18.<br />No Anders is not a terrorist.<br />No Solas is not trying to destroy
the fucking world.<br />No Sera is not awesome just because she's a
lesbian.<br />No Bioware is not racist just because elves or Qunari
exist.<br />No Loghain is not an anti-semitic trope.<br /><br />FFS. Stop. I'm
exhausted.<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://enigmalea.dreamwidth.org/62581.html">Snowflake

19:47:15 GMT Snowflake Challenge 2: Write a promo, manifesto or primer.
https://enigmalea.dreamwidth.org/62292.html <p>This one is more difficult for me
than it should be because I have a really difficult time choosing favorites, but
I "settled" for one blorbo from Dragon Age who's been on my mind a lot and who I
don't see get a ton of attention in the circles I travel in.</p> <h2>The Iron
Bull</h2> <p>If you know <em>nothing</em> about The Iron Bull I suggest you
check out <a href="https://codepen.io/enigmalea/full/bGYvOdR">this tribute
page</a> that I made for freeCodeCamp last year (and really need to figure out
how to move to my website) for a good overviews. Because I spent way too long on
this, and it's reaching true manifesto proportions, I decided to split it into
multiple entries.</p> <p>This first entry will focus on Qunari and the Qun in
general, and there will be one or maybe two more focusing on The Iron Bull
himself.</p> <p>If you have any questions you want answered about Qunari, the
Qun, or The Iron Bull (or other Qunari characters!), please let me know and I'll
be happy to answer them, or make sure to include them in a future entry.</p>

<a href="#culture">culture</a></center> <a name="basics"></a> <u><strong>b a s i
c s</strong></u></p> <p>The Iron Bull is part of a fictional race and religion
in Dragon Age called the <em>Qunari</em> who follow the <em>Qun</em>. The
nomenclature can be a bit confusing, and even fans get this wrong, so don't fret
too much over it, but for the sake of clarity:</p> <ul> <li>kossith - what the
race of large, horned beings was called prior to the advent of the Qun. This is
no longer used and, in fact, using this word is actively discouraged by the
Qun.</li> <li>Qunari - a follower of the Qun, whether they are of the horned
race or not. Although it's difficult to tell because of the way text is
presented in game (often in all caps) it <em>seems</em> that if "qunari" is
capitalized it refers to all followers, while a lowercase presentation is used
for the race which has become synonymous with the religion. </li>
<li>Viddathari - non-horned race individuals (elves, humans, dwarves) who have
converted to the Qun. </li> <li>Tal-Vashoth - someone who was raised in or
converted to the Qun who leaves the Qun. </li> <li>Vashoth - a horned-race child
raised outside of the Qun, usually as the product of at least one Tal-Vashoth
parent.</li> <li>bas - people of other races who do not follow the Qun (it's
worth noting that this literally translates to "<em>thing</em>").</li> </ul>
<p>Calling the Qun a "religion" is a bit simplistic in my opinion. The Qun
encompasses a full way of life - religion, government, and culture - and to
really understand it, we need to take a look a all three parts.</p>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p> <p><a name="religion"></a><u><strong>r e l i g i o
n</strong></u></p> <p>The Qun is - in many ways - more a philosophy than a
religion, based primarily on the writings of Koslun. Koslun is not a god, but is
identified as a philosopher (called an Ashkaari in Qunlat, "<em>one who
seeks</em>"). Although there doesn't seem to be any gods as central figures,
David Gaider (the lead writer for Dragon Age until 2016) stated the Qun is not
an atheistic system.</p> <p>We don't have a lot of information on the inner
workings of the Qun as the society is relatively insular, but my personal theory
is that the Qun is non-atheistic because it holds at its core a variation of
spiritual animism. The few
<a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Qun#Extracts_from_the_Qun">Qun
excerpts</a> we have from canon seem to recognize the spiritual existence of the
world around Koslun even as he's "alone". </p> <p>The main tenants of the Qun's
religion/philosophy seem to be:</p> <ul> <li>everything in the universe has a
purpose</li> <li>struggling against that purpose is harmful to yourself and to
the world around you</li> <li>individuals are a small part of the whole picture
of the universe</li> <li>you can make a choice to accept your place in the
universe and that will lessen/end your suffering</li> </ul>
<p><a href="#top">top</a></p> <p><a name="government"></a><u><strong>g o v e r n
m e n t</strong></u></p> <p>The Qunari government draws heavy inspiration from
real life communism, but tweaks It a lot in an attempt to "make it work". The
Qun is run by a triumvirate of the Ariqun (leader of the religion), Arishok
(leader of the military), and the Arigena (leader of craftsmen). Each prong of
the Qun represents a different part of a being: the Ariqun being the "soul", the
Arishok being the "body", and the Arigena being the "mind". In addition, due to
the way the Qun approaches gender (more on that later), each leader has a
specific gender: the Arishok is always male, the Arigena is female, and the
Ariqun has a varied gender.</p> <p>The government owns all means of production,
and Qunari are provided with rations of goods and services. There's very little
detail about <em>how</em> the rationing is distributed, and it seems Qunari
whose roles take them outside of the reach of the Qun (for example, spies) may
not receive their share or may only receive certain goods.</p> <p>The Arishok's
main purpose is to expand the Qun's reach through war and occupation. Although
the Qun accepts peaceful converts (primarily in the north of the continent where
they have permanent settlements), a great deal of their attempted conversion
relies on a "convert or die" philosophy. This has led to Qunari having a
reputation for being bloodthirsty and warlike, though the Qun seems to object to
tactics that are too brutal based on the short story "Three Trees to Midnight"
featured in
<a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Tevinter_Nights">Tevinter
Nights</a>.</p> <p>The Qunari government rules over the island nation of Par
Vollen, though there are a few permanent Qunari settlements in other countries
in the northern parts of Thedas (the main continent where Dragon Age takes
place). The island nation of Seheron has been the site of a long and bitter
territorial war between the Qun and Tevinter.</p> <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<a href="#doubt">doubt</a></center></p>
<p><a name="identity"></a><em>Identity</em></p> <p>Formally, Qunari do not have
individual names - neither first nor familial - their name is assigned to them
according to their role; for example, Sten, Tallis, and Arishok, are all roles
(jobs) that individuals perform within the Qun. This practice is primarily based
on a quote from the Qun: "To call a thing by its name is to know its reason in
the world. To call a thing falsely is to put out one's own eyes."</p> <p>Since
an individual's role can change over time (through promotions) an individual can
have many names throughout their life. All Qunari have at least two: Imekari
("<em>child</em>") and their initial role.</p> <p>Informally, there doesn't seem
to be any <em>punishment</em> for using nicknames, and it seems that in
practice, at least a few Qunari give or receive nicknames to set them apart from
others.</p> <p>In addition to their role deciding their name, it also assigns
the individual's <em>gender</em>. For example, all Qunari warriors are male,
regardless of their biological sex. While some fans interpret this to mean that
Qunari are accepting of trans individuals (primarily because it was explained by
The Iron Bull in relation to his second in command, Krem, a trans man), in
reality, this simply means they assign gender differently than other cultures.
The idea of a female warrior is unheard of to them, not because of biological
sex differences, but because if you are a talented warrior who is born with
female sex characteristics, they simply decide you are male.</p> <p>We have no
canon information on whether all roles under the Arigena (leader of the
craftspeople) are considered female in the same way that roles under the Arishok
are male, but it does seem clear that roles under the Ariqun (leader of the
religion) can be any gender, just as the Ariqun can. Some roles under the Ariqun
are female only, while others are male only. A few roles do accept persons of
either gender; for these roles, we don't know if this means gender is decided by
sex characteristics or by personal identification.</p>
<p><a href="#culture">culture</a> | <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><a name="relationships"></a><em>Relationships</em></p> <p>Qunari do not have
families in the way that we are used to. All qunari are raised in group
situations with one Tamassran (a female-only role under the Ariqun) responsible
for raising multiple children at one time. The Tamassrans provide the general
education of Imekari (self-sufficiency) and assign their role under the Qun when
they turn 12.</p> <p>Qunari do not have romantic or sexual relationships in the
way we think of them. Instead, the Qun practices a selective breeding program
which is run by the Tamassrans in order to produce children. This isn't to say
that Qunari don't experience love, but romantic love and sexual attraction are
not mixed. If a child is conceived outside of the selective breeding program,
the child is placed with other Qunari children while their parents are sent for
re-education (more on this later).</p> <p>In the cities of Par Vollen, adult
Qunari live in hive-like structures with each person claiming a single domicile
for themselves.</p> <p><a href="#culture">culture</a> |
<a href="#top">top</a></p> <p><a name="doubt"></a><em>Doubt</em></p> <p>Doubting
the Qun is seen as normal, as one cannot have faith without doubt. Asking
questions and seeking answers is encouraged. This only becomes an issue when it
leads someone to resist their place in the Qun or to take actions which are
against the Qun's direction; as mentioned above, having a child outside of the
breeding program is one such action.</p> <p>When someone does fail in their
duties to the Qun, they are sent for re-education. There is not a lot of canon
information concerning re-education, but it seems to utilize brainwashing
techniques to remove or suppress or rewrite memories and to reinforce the
teachings of the Qun.</p> <p>If someone resists re-education or it fails, they
may be given <em>qamek</em>, a blue, glowing fiery substance which effectively
turns them into mindless labor. They may also be forced to work in mines,
construction, or other labor camps.</p> <p><a href="#culture">culture</a> |

Updates https://enigmalea.dreamwidth.org/61967.html <p>Let's stop pretending
these are gonna be weekly, huh? LOL</p> <p>I've had another fatigue crash, so
I've not been working which means that I "accomplished" a lot, but only because
I wasn't working. I'm hoping my trip to my endo next week can discover whatever
is causing these crashes. </p> <p><strong>Dragon Age Fandom</strong></p> <ul>
<li>A bit techy, too, I launched a website for
<a href="http://thehangedmanpub.netlify.app">The Hanged Man</a>, as well as
spent some time redefining what The Hanged Man was. It started as "just a
discord server" but I'd rather it be more than that - a fan organization that
spans across social media. I don't know that it's going to work, but I really
hope so!</li> <li>I also uploaded the coloring book Bioware released to the
public and Warden's Fall to the Internet Archive. I plan on checking to make
sure certain things (like the free short stories, etc) are archived, too. You
can find the coloring book
<a href="https://archive.org/details/dacoloringbook">here</a> and Warden's Fall
<a href="https://archive.org/details/dragon-age-wardens-fall">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Officially finished everything involving DAA.</strong> Activity book
was released. Flash sale was done! (I do have to mail three packages,) Created
the AO3 collection for this year. All I have left is posting my fics and writing
some meta!</li> </ul> <p><strong>Tech</strong></p> <ul> <li>In addition to the
website above, I did a bunch of background work for parts of the website and
discord to work. I set-up some new Airtable stuff for the QOTD to run, and set
up the info for the Fic Club we're running. (I'm super excited for that.)</li>
<li>Did some minor updates to my website focusing on content. I renamed my
"Vault" to "Digital Garden" since that's.... technically what it is, moved
obsidian out of my open source section, since I realized it's... free, but not
open source, added raindrop.io to my open source suggestions, etc, etc.</li>
<li>I wrote up four tutorials for AO3 to help people in DAA who have never used
collections, posted art, added co-creators, or posted a translation. You can
find them <a href="https://www.enigmalea.quest/docs/ao3">here</a>.</li> <li>I
poked at formatting for a mastodon integration for my website. It's not
production ready yet, and I have a lot of things to figure out and script, but I
have a general game plan!</li> <li>I started the rewrite for my discord bot,
Archivist, which scrapes AO3 for info and displays it in Discord since the
metadata used for embedding links is slim on info. This allows users to know
what they're clicking ahead of time.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Currently
Watching</strong></p> <ul> <li>Sort of a misnomer for this category, since we
finished it all, but we powered our way through the entirety of <em>Steven
Universe</em>. It's a delightful show!</li> <li>We finally watched <em>The Power
of the Doctor.</em> It was so good. I'm sad to see Jodie go, but am super
excited for the 60th Anniversary.</li> <li>Our current escapade is catching up
on Hot Ones episodes. We apparently missed a bunch during the pandemic.</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Currently Playing</strong></p> <ul> <li>I'm still poking at
<em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em> occasionally.</li> <li>A concentrated run to
finish one of my DA:I playthroughs is in my future.</li> </ul>

Update https://enigmalea.dreamwidth.org/61601.html An only slightly late weekly
update this time! There's not much to see beneath the cut, as it's been an
incredibly busy week, but not much fandom or tech busy. Work the last two weeks
has been <em>awful</em> and between that and holiday prep I'm going slightly
insane.<br /><br />Minor CW for discussion of parental abuse SL in the
<strong>My Hero Academia</strong> section
below!<br /><br /><a name="cutid1"></a><h2>Currently Watching</h2><strong>My
Hero Academia, Season 5</strong><br />We started watching this last year when
the movie went out because my niece wanted to see the movie. We caught up, saw
the movie, tried to watch Season 5 and ran into issues with things being
paywalled or subbed, and my ADD doesn't play well with subs. So now that the
dubs are freely available on Hulu we're catching up.<br /><br />A bunch of this
season feels like filler for plot, but we sure are getting a lot of backstory on
the characters. I've seen some criticism of Endeavor's storyline in the past -
people assuming that he was being "forgiven" or "excused" for being abusive, but
I like the way they're handling this. I like that some of children are not ready
to forgive him and they're all healing from it
differently.<br /><br /><h2>Projects</h2><strong>Dragon Age
Annual</strong><br />Nearly <em>all</em> of the free time I've had has gone into
compiling the translation files for the DAA. We're down to two languages left to
go and the activity book. We were supposed to be done by Dec 15, but health and
life got in the way. 😓<br /><br /><h2>Tech</h2>Two recs that I nearly forgot
about, and I can't believe it. The DAA would not exist without
this.<br /><br /><strong>Photopea</strong><br />In browser, online photoshop. It
has nearly all the features of photoshop but is free with ads. You can
essentially donate \$3.30 for a month's access without ads. I haven't been
paying for the months I've used it for DAA, but I'm going to throw the dev some
money at the beginning of the year to make up for that, as well as pay for next
year when I'm back using his bandwidth.<br /><br />You should
<a href="https://www.photopea.com">check it
out</a>.<br /><br /><strong>PDF24</strong><br />I was paying for Adobe PDF
Creator for the calendar, and uh... never again. Adobe and I had an angry
one-sided break-up. I was struggling with prohibitively large file sizes AND
terrible quality. I happened to see PDF24 mentioned on a pillowfort post that
has the "alternatives to Adobe products" that recirculates
randomly.<br /><br />It's online, but can be downloaded too. They support
themselves with ads on their site and paid options for fax
services.<br /><br />So far, we've been able to create higher quality, lossless
PDFs with much, MUCH more manageable file sizes for free with no watermark. Do
highly recommend. It also comes in multiple languages!

(Bi)Weekly Update https://enigmalea.dreamwidth.org/61281.html I promised myself
I would post a weekly update here and <strong>immediately</strong> failed. To be
fair to myself, I've been feeling generally <em>unwell</em> since last weekend
when I intended to do this, so I've not had much energy to do things. I'm
feeling better today and can only hope I continue to feel
better.<br /><br />Even feeling unwell I've managed to knock out a lot of little
(and not so little) fandom-related things in the last two weeks! There's so much
here I ended up needing a cut. I maaaaaay have taken advantage of taking off
from
work.<br /><a name="cutid1"></a><br /><h2>Tech</h2><strong><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify
CMS</a></strong><br />On Nov 27, I added this content management system to my
website so I can post blogs and (hopefully) update pages on the go. The next
day, I was able to successfully post from the system, but it seems I might need
to fix some settings because a direct link to the post isn't working. I also
need to work a bit on the ability to update
pages.<br /><br /><strong><a href="https://www.postybirb.com/">PostyBirb+</a></strong><br />Last
week, I found a link to PostyBirb on

website or blog entry and decided to try it out. So far I'm in love. I'm still
getting used to it, but I've been able to move a bunch of my fanfic posts from
tumblr to pillowfort with just a few clicks. It was also super useful in posting
the final posts for the DA Polyshipping Exchange!<br /><br /><h3>New
Layouts</h3>I updated the layouts of both this blog and my community

for my personal blog. I've updated the color scheme to match
<a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin">catpuccin, macchiato
flavor</a> which I use on my website as my dark theme. It's become a personal
favorite color scheme for my dark theme since it's low contrast enough not to
hurt my eyes, but still legible.<br /><br />I did tweak the layout some to use
some art my BFF

of my fave rarepairs. You can find it on AO3

I used it for the base of my catpuccin skin listed below.

Catpuccin Macchiato</a> - I used the above skin as a base and updated it to my
current fave dark mode and fonts. While working on this I noticed a couple of
places that were missed by the original skin that I'm going to try to edit in,
so if you use it, be sure to update when updates are
available.<br /><br /><strong>MyAnimeList Antisocial</strong> - not posted
anywhere, but I also created a MAL theme to remove all the social networking
parts of the site. I'm waiting for a bit to use it to make sure I didn't miss
anything before sharing.<br /><br /><h2>Dragon Age</h2>So much went on in the
fandom it gets it's own category!<br /><br /><strong>DA Day</strong> happened on
Dec 4th. Bioware released the DA coloring book as a PDF for download and a new
short story. My To Do list includes sharing these with my DW comm and updating
the Media Timeline I've created. I usually offer the short stories as PDFs and
epubs, but I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet. I want to re-do my old ones
as I hate the formatting, too, so that project might be finished a little
later.<br /><br />I did FINALLY get my DA Polyshipping fics shared for that day,
though! I created banners for them both and shared them on mastodon, twitter,
and pillowfort. I still need to get them crossposted to

though.<br /><br /><strong>Dragon Age: Absolution</strong> dropped on Netflix on
Friday. I watched it all twice. It's amazing! I have a lot more thoughts, but I
haven't gotten a chance to coherent them yet.<br /><br /><strong>Dragon Age
Annual</strong> - I also spent some time working on word searches and crosswords
and putting together the DAA bonus PDF activity book. We're in the home stretch
for finishing up things for the Annual.<br /><br /><h2>Gaming</h2>I've mostly
been playing <em>Pokemon Scarlet</em>. In the last two weeks I:<ul><li>finished
all three main storylines</li><li>completed a raid with my partner for Charizard
the Unrivaled</li><li>completed the Pokedex!</li></ul>I still have some post
game storylines to complete including re-battling all the gym leaders, the ace
tournament, and unlocking six star raids. I hope to finish all that in time for
the second round of Charizard the Unrivaled, so my partner and I have more raids
to do together, in addition to doing them
online.<br /><br /><br />
