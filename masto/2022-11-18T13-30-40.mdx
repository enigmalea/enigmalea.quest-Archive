<span class="hashtag">#DragonAge</span> Community I've been thinking a bit about our growing presence on Mastodon, and thought about how we have an opportunity here to define the
culture of the DA fandom.

In addition to the general Mastodon culture of accessibility, support of creative expression, and inclusion, we should agree to:

> use tags liberally so people can find and filter content
>
> with the release of <span class="hashtag">#DragonAgeAbsolution</span> and <span class="hashtag">#DragonAgeDreadwolf</span>, use CWs for spoilers
>
> support liberal use of reporting, filtering, and blocking before harassment
>
> use clearly labeled CWs for criticisms and negativity (i'd say don't post it but we know that's not realistic!)
>
> favorite and boost with wild abandon

ultimately, we have an opportunity to remove the shitstirrers and bad actors from our experience here, and to deplatform them in a way not possible on other social media, and I think that's pretty neat.
