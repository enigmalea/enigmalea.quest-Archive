Just pushed a bunch of changes to my <span class="hashtag">#website</span>, including adding a masto link so I'm verified.

You can check out all the changes here: https://www.enigmalea.quest/blog/update-log-4

Ignore the bits where I say I filed issues on my github. I was GOING to file issues, but then I had merge conflicts and other shenangans that made me want to sob, and put me behind.

And now I have write like a mad person to finish this exchange fic that was due last week. This is fine.
