Taking a quick break from writing to tell <span class="hashtag">#DragonAge</span> fans about the fact I
finished setting up a <span class="hashtag">#Dreamwidth</span> community for DA fans who are 18+.

You can find it here: https://hangedmanpub.dreamwidth.org/profile

I started it earlier this year, but recently finished setting it up because of
the impending birdsite implosion.

For those not familiar, Dreamwidth is an Livejournal clone focused on long-form
blogging. They've been around since 2009 and were formed during a lot of the
purges, strikethroughs, and corporate shenanigans that inspired <span class="hashtag">#ao3</span>

They remain a free platform, have no ads, allow NSFW content, and have a history
of making business decisions which allow fandom communities to continue to
thrive.
