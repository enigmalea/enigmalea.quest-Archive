## About the Repo

My repository for my personal webpage - a home for my random stuff that doesn't
quite fit on any other social media. Part dev log, part portfolio, part fandom
blatherings. You can see it live at [enigmalea.quest](https://www.enigmalea.quest).

## Technology

The website was built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) which uses a
combination of markdown, React, javascript, html, and css to generate a static
site. The site is hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Dev Info

I've dabbled in HTML and CSS on and off for 25+ years for various fandom and
hobby pursuits. in February 2021, I woke up one day and decided to make a
Discord bot. I haven't really stopped coding since.

Right now, my focus is on learning various languages and technologies through
fandom projects - my bot, running exchanges, building communities, and making
tools for other fandom enthusiasts to use.
