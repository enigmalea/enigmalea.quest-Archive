# Stylus

Stylus is an open-source fork of Stylish for Chrome, also compatible with
Firefox as a WebExtension. It's used to install custom user CSS that changes the
way websites look for you, by overwriting the default styles of the web page.

## Install

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
  (and other Chromium browsers like Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, etc.)

## Recommended Skins

- [Catpuccin Github](https://github.com/catppuccin/github)
  - Soothing pastel theme for high-spirited people adapted for Github.
- [Fandom (Clean) (Updated)](https://userstyles.world/style/4456/fandom-clean-updated)
  - Removes excessive ads, moving parts, and the yellow sidebar from fandom.com
    to make the site more usable.
