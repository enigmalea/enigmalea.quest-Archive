# Obsidian

[Obsiain.md](https://obsidian.md) is an open-source free personal wiki (think
OneNote, Evernote, or Google Keep) where you can store reference information,
organize your life, or just take notes.

## What I'm Using It For

- Language Learning: Swedish

  - Obsidian allows you to spell check with multiple languages, which makes it
    ideal for language learning or for people who are multilingual and take
    notes in various languages. No longer will you be plagued by the dreaded red
    squiggle because your spellchecker is English when you're typing in Swedish.

- Coding Notes

  - Obsidian uses markdown and handles codeblocks very easily.

- Shared Notebook: Writing & Projects
  - I have a lot of projects and several of them I share with other people.
    Obsidian Vaults can be stored on gDrive or OneDrive to share with other
    people. **Note:** It is not designed to work this way and this is a hack.
    You do have to be careful not to override notes by making sure you're
    working on different documents.

## What I Don't Use It For

- On the Go Notes
  - I'm still beholden to OneNote for this, as the Obsidian interface for iOS is
    currently less than desirable. _stares wistfully into the distance_ One day.
