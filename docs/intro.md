# The Vault

Inspired by [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)'s "vault" structure for personal wikis, The Vault is the place where I shove all my random knowledge and the various cool things I like. You can find anything from random subjects I fell down a rabbit hole about, fandom obsessions, lists of things I like, various bits of knowledge, and possibly a dragon or two.

This isn't a **blog**, since it's not chronological or conversational. It's just a shared notebook for bits and bobbles.

Enjoy!
