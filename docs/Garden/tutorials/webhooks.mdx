# Creating Webhooks For Discord

:::note

You must be a server owner or have the manage webhooks permission to
complete this tutorial! You must also be using either the desktop or web
browser client. Webhooks cannot currently be created on mobile.

:::

1. Click on <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> next to the Server's
   name, then select **Server Settings**.

   **Webhooks** area.

3. Click on the **New Webhook** button and a settings box will show up. Here you
   can upload whatever avatar you'd like, choose the username it posts with, and
   also decide what channel it can post to.

:::tip

If you've made changes to the webhook's avatar, user name, or channel,
don't forget to select the **Save Changes** dialogue that appears at the
bottom of the Discord window.

:::note

These settings can be changed later by following the same step to
access the webhooks. Instead of click the New Webhook button, you simply
select the already existing webhook.

:::

That's it! You're done. You can click the **Copy Webhook URL** to get the URL
needed to make things post to the channel. This can be used with services like
IFTTT, Zapier, Pipedream, and more!
