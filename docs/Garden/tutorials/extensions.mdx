# Extension Request Tutorial

This tutorial focuses on creating an extension request form for your fanworks
exchange so that people can complete a form to ask for an extension. It also
provides you with a way to track extensions easier. There's also a small bit of
**optional** coding which will allow you to send a notification to your Discord
when a new request is made.

## Create Accounts

To start, you'll need to create two accounts. I recommend that you use google
login if your mod team shares a gmail account, that way there's no additional
passwords to remember or share.

1. [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) Airtable is a cloud-based
   database-spreadsheet hybrid which allows you to leverage the complicated
   features of a database, with the ease of use of a spreadsheet. If you can
   handle google sheets, you can handle Airtable!

2. [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) Pipedream is an automation service (like
   IFTTT or Zapier) which has generous limits for how many runs you get on the
   free plan. It also has fewer limitations if you can code, as it allows direct
   access to write your own javascript programs to be triggered by APIs. Don't
   worry if you don't know what that means.

## Creating the Base/Table

:::caution

If you're not very coding savvy, you'll want to follow my directions for naming
and what fields to create <u>exactly</u> as this will prevent you from having to
edit the code.

:::

1. In Airtable, create a new base in your workspace by clicking "Add a base."
   :::note

   Airtable may provide an initial base for you. You can absolutely edit that
   base instead of creating a new one.

2. At the top click the "Untitled Base" to change the name to "Extension
   Requests". You can also set the icon and color to your liking.

3. Rename "Table 1" to "Extensions". ![](https://i.imgur.com/ShvjDbN.png)

**ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! You've set up your first base and are ready to customize your
fields.**

### Customizing Fields

:::note

The instructions below are <u>not</u> step-by-step as I really encourage you to
click through Airbase to learn about it's options. It's a super useful
organization tool!

:::

All bases come pre-populated with four fields. You can edit the four initial
fields and create three more for a total of seven. In the end you should end up
with the following fields:

<details><summary>Field Details</summary>

| Field Name              | Field Type    | Options                                                       | Notes                                                                                                                       |

| Date                    | Date          |                                                               |                                                                                                                             |
| Method of Communication | Single Select | Email<br />Discord<br />Twitter                               | Set-up with options you have for communication. This is so people can select how they want you to send them their approval. |
| Email                   | Email         |                                                               |                                                                                                                             |

:::note

If you don't use Tumblr or Discord for communications you can delete these
fields. There are instructions for removing these fields from the code. If
you're feeling super confident or are code savvy, you can change these to other
forms of communication, i.e. Twitter username, Dreamwidth username, etc.

2. Add the Field Name, select the type, and complete any options that appear.

</details>

<details><summary>The Status Field Explained</summary>

The status field exists for the mod team to keep track of what the progress is
on the extension. As requests come in, they are not assigned a status.

As you review, update, and contact participants, you will be changing this
field.

- _Approved_ - You've reviewed the request and let the participant know they're
  good to go.
- _Fulfilled_ - They posted their work. No follow-ups are needed.
- _Waiting for Update_ - You've hit the initial deadline and haven't heard from
  them. You've sent a check-in. I leave this status for up to 24 hours after the
  check-in has set.
- _Past Due_ - PANIC MODE. There has been no reply to the check-in for 24 hours
  and there is no posted work. Time to consider posting for a pinch hit or
  defaulting them.

</details>

### Setting Up Form And Calendar Views (_Optional_)

The grid view that shows up initially isn't the only way to view the data that
Airtable provides. There are several other ways to view data that makes things
easier to manage. I encourage you to explore the options for what works best for
your mod team. The two below are my personal faves for this type of base.

**To Create a New View:** In the left hand sidebar at the bottom, click the plus
next to the new type of view you'd like to use. You can name these views
whatever you'd like as they don't impact the code in any way.

<details><summary>Form View</summary>

Sort of the meat of the idea, but optional nonetheless! The form allows you to
create a form that participants can complete to request an extension. I won't
walk you through a step-by-step set-up, but I will give you some hints and tips!

**Tips & Hints:**

- **Be sure to explain the form as a whole.** Feel free to use the language I
  have below as a guideline. You'll want to address how information is stored -
  I recommend not storing it past the end of the exchange and actually deleting
  all entries. This allows you to comply with various privacy laws and reuse the
  form every year.
- **DO NOT LIST THE STATUS FIELD ON YOUR FORM.** That field is for the mod team
  to keep track of that status of the extension and participants shouldn't have
  access to it.
- **Set all fields as required.** Because the email and username fields are
  conditional, they are only required if they are displayed!

#### Adding Help Text

You'll notice that the date field has additional information/instructions.

To add this, click on the field in the form view and complete the "Add some help
text" section.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ihrZS6G.png)

#### Making A Field Conditional

Toggle the "Show field only when conditions are met" to **on**.

Set your condition to "When Method of Communication is" and the name of the
field. For example, for the email field you'd select "When Method of
Communication is Email" ![](https://i.imgur.com/Nzkj3XG.png)

I recommend you do this for all emails and usernames you request as someone only
needs to provide you one.

#### Other Form Options

At the bottom of the view, you'll find various options you can experiment with.
I turn **off** "Show 'Submit another response' button" and "Show a new blank
form after 5 seconds" for this form, as people should only be submitting it
once.

I also turn **on** sending an email as a back-up notification in case Pipedream
fails for some reason.

In addition, I do always customize the message shown after submission. Feel free
to use my wording as a guideline.

```
Thank you for requesting an extension. The mods will review your request and get back to you within 24 hours at the latest.

Please keep in mind that your request is not official until you hear from us!
```

#### Sharing Your Form

At the top you can get a share link for your form. This can be added to any of
your exchange information just like any other link can. This menu also allows
you to get code for an iframe embed, or to turn the form off so that it no
longer can accept responses (a good idea between exchanges).
![](https://i.imgur.com/X3Gdz6m.png)

</details>

<details><summary>Calendar View</summary>

The Calendar View is useful for two reasons: first, it gives you a visual of
what extensions are due on what days and their status, and second, it allows you
to get a calendar link to sync to your google or other calendar app.

Once again, I'm not doing step-by-step instructions, but providing hints for
setup!

#### Customizing Labels

For me, the most important thing here, is seeing the AO3 username on the date.
If I have to reach out to someone for an update, etc, I'll sign into the
airtable. You may want to include communication info, etc.

Click on customize labels and toggle on items you want to show and off items you
don't. You can also rearrange the order of items by clicking the six dots on the
right side of the field and dragging up or down.

:::info

Since the Calendar is being generated from the date field, there's no need to
display it!

#### Filtering By Status

Calendar view is most useful if you filter the records to only show approved and
outstanding extensions.

To do this, click "Filtered by" and choose "Status is not empty". This will make
sure that it's been at least approved. Then click "Add condition" and set the
second condition to "And Status is not Fulfilled" to exclude completed
extensions.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pptMaMY.png)

#### Syncing To Your Calendar

To sync to your calendar, click "Share view" on the main toolbar, and then
select "Sync to an external calendar". ![](https://i.imgur.com/hymlzpI.png)

## Using Pipedream For Discord Notifications

1. Once you've signed into Pipedream (once again, for exchange mods, I recommend
   using the shared gmail if you have one), click the New button on the upper
   right to create a new workflow.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/TWXdX8F.png)

2. In the upper left corner, click on "Untitled Workflow" to rename it. I used
   "Extension Requests", but you can use anything you'd like here.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/vshS374.png)

3. In the center of your screen there will be a dialogue box asking you to
   choose a "trigger". For automations, triggers are the events that tell the
   code to run. In this case, we want it to run when the form for a request is
   completed or a mod adds one by hand. In other words, we want it to run every
   time a new entry shows up in our Airtable.

   Select Airtable from the list. <span className="inlineNote">You may have to
   type "Airtable" in the Search for an app field to get it to show for
   you.</span>

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/U4Y7uy2.png)

4. From the new dialogue that appears select **New Records**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Leb1swk.png)

5. Click on "Connect an Airtable account" and follow the current instructions to
   generate an API key, add it to Pipedream, add a nickname (_optional_), and
   click the Save button.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/gVkEJpa.png)

6. Complete the following fields:

   - **Timer** - how frequently Pipedream checks your base for new records. If
     this is the only thing you're using Pipedream for on this account you can
     go as low as every 10 minutes and not hit your monthly limit. I tend to
     leave mine at the default 15 minutes.
   - **Base** - the name of the Base you want to use. If you followed my guide
     exactly it should be "Extension Requests".
   - **Table** - the name of the table you want to use. If you followed my guide
     exactly it should be "Extensions".
   - **Name** - An internal source name for Pipedream. I use something like
     "[Exchange] Airtable New Records" so that if I do more than one workflow,
     I'll be able to manage my sources easier.

   Your completed trigger should look something like this:

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/EZ1mTsW.png)

   Click the **Create source** button.

   :::note

   Don't worry, this trigger can be easily edited at any time if you made a mistake or need to make updates.
