# Digital Garden

Inspired by [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)'s "vault" structure for personal
wikis and the digital garden philosophy, my Digital Garden is the place where I
shove all my random knowledge and the various cool things I like. You can find
anything from random subjects I fell down a rabbit hole about, fandom
obsessions, lists of things I like, various bits of knowledge, and possibly a
dragon or two.

This is my shared notebook for bits and baubles.

Enjoy!
