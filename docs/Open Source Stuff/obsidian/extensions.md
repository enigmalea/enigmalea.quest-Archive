# Themes, Extensions, & Snippets
Obsidian is highly customizable. Each vault you create is it's own environment and can be catered to its uses; this allows you to - for example - have a notebook specifically to learn another language which uses the multiple spellcheck setting while your main notebook is set to spell check only your primary language.

## Themes
### Themes I'm Using
- [Blue Topaz](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/theme-blue-topaz-v5-5-updated-20211218-for-v0-13-12-and-mobile-v1-0-5/6425)
    - **Used For:** Main Vault, Shared Projects
    - **Best With:** [Style Settings Extension](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) to customize the theme's colors and appearance.

- [Obsidian Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal)
    - **Used For:** Swedish Vault
    - **Best With:** [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) for control over colors and appearance.

- [Ebullientworks Theme](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-theme-ebullientworks)
